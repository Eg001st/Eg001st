### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yehor and I am a 22-year-old computer game engineer graduate from Akademia FinansÃ³w I Biznesu Vistula (Vistula University In Warsaw). I have been passionate about making computer games since I was at school. As a junior developer I am interested in all aspects of creating video games - from making up the idea to publishing the finished product. Currently, I focuse on writing gameplay logic and in my spare time I experiment with AI in Unreal Engine 4/5 as well. Moreover, I learn not only Unreal Engine Framework but also a pure C++. I have two convictions: the first one is "practice makes perfect" and the second -"lifelong learning".
